###### Assumptions

1. In each round the trajectory of the bird is simulated randomly from a random start position and random end position.
2. The starting point of the trajectory is randomly chosen and can be any cell position on the edge of the checkerboard. 
3. The trajctory of the bird ends if it moves outside the checkerboard. This means that the last cell which the bird visits can be any cell positions on the edge of the checkerboard. 
3. The bird does not repeat any cell of the grid in it's trajectory
